    <h1>Evolving Strategies in Amblyopia Management</h1>
    
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        Amblyopia, commonly referred to as "lazy eye," is a prevalent visual disorder affecting children and, in some cases, adults.
        Traditional treatments, including occlusion therapy and pharmacological approaches, have demonstrated efficacy but also face
        limitations related to adherence, age dependency, and recurrence rates.
        This narrative review explores evolving strategies in amblyopia management, from conventional therapies to emerging innovations.
        Dichoptic therapy, which leverages binocular visual stimulation, represents a paradigm shift by directly addressing neural
        suppression and improving stereopsis.
        Technological advancements, such as virtual reality (VR), AI, and eye-tracking technologies, have further revolutionized
        treatment approaches, enhancing compliance and enabling personalized care.
        Additionally, recent research in neuroplasticity has opened new avenues for treating adult amblyopia, challenging previous
        assumptions about its irreversibility.
        Despite these advancements, challenges persist in treatment standardization, accessibility, and long-term efficacy.
